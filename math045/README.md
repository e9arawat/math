# Problem 45
## Triangular, Pentagonal, and Hexagonal

Triangle, pentagonal, and hexagonal numbers are generated by the following formulae:

- Triangle &nbsp; $T_{n}=n(n+1)/2$ &nbsp; $[1, 3, 6, 10, 15, ...]$

- Pentagonal &nbsp; $P_{n}=n(3n - 1)/2$ &nbsp; $[1, 5, 12, 22, 35, ...]$

- Hexagonal &nbsp; $H_{n}=n(2n - 1)$ &nbsp; $[1, 6, 15, 28, 45, ...]$

It can be verified that $T_{285} = P_{165} = H_{143} = 40755$.
Find the next triangle number that is also pentagonal and hexagonal.
